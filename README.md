## Definition

Special tool to update the *Windows Defender* definitions in the local network without client internet access via internal web server.

[Top](#wideredist-)

## Details

This project was not developed to lock out or even screw *Microsoft*, rather than for updating *Windows Defender* definitons (or signatures) in internal environments that are completely separated from the internet.

Nevertheless, this requires at least one system to access the internet, of course.

This tool currently takes advantage of a *Linux* server (or alternatively *BSD*) which downloads the definition files and redistributes them using a web server and the *PowerShell* on the *Windows* systems to obtain the definition updates from that web server.

## Requirements

The project does not have many requirements.

*   ***Linux*** or ***BSD***:
    *   Some web server such as *Apache* or *nginx* (latter has been used in development).
    *   The `rsync` package (already pre-installed in most *Linux* distributions).
    *   The `wget` package (should also already be pre-installed).
    *   The *Bash* shell (default in most distributions).
*   ***Windows***:
    *   The *Windows Defender* as well as the *PowerShell* which should both be already pre-installed.

## Installation

### Server side

First, the steps which are required on a *Linux* or *BSD* machine.

#### Web server

As already mentioned above, you need a web server to provide the downloaded definitions.

Please do not ask me about the base configuration of a web server, as there are plenty how-tos online.

Below is a sample site config file for *nginx* listening on port 8080 using `/var/www/html/defender` as document root.

```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    root /var/www/html/defender;
    location / {
        autoindex on;
    }
}
```

When finished, create the corresponding directory

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/html/defender
```

with the temporary file called `test` inside it:

```bash
touch /var/www/html/defender/test
```

Now you can test if the web server works by restarting its service, opening a browser and navigating to the corresponding URL, for example `http://192.168.2.1:8080`. You should see a typical index page with the heading `Index of /` there and the `test` file listed below.

After that, you can remove the temporary file again:

```bash
rm -f /var/www/html/defender/test
```

#### *WiDeRedist* script and config

As **root**, create the directory `/opt/wideredist` and copy the `wideredist.sh` script as well as the `wideredist.conf` file there.

The script should already be executable. If not (for whatever reason), run the following command to set the executable flag:

```bash
chmod +x /opt/wideredist/wideredist.sh
```

Inside the `wideredist.conf` file you can also set the directory where the definition files should be downloaded to and proxy settings (if required). Notice that if you change the definition path inside the config file, you also have to apply that change to your web server config.

Manually run the script as follows to see if it works as expected:

```bash
/opt/wideredist/wideredist.sh
```

In case the download fails, check if the settings inside `wideredist.conf` are correct and that the system is able to access the internet.

#### Cronjob

Finally, you may add a cronjob to `/etc/crontab` to automatically download the latest definitions, e.g. each hour:

```bash
# Download and redistribute latest Windows Defender definitions
0 * * * * root /opt/wideredist/wideredist.sh &>/dev/null
```

Nevertheless, it is recommended to run the script manually once in a while as it returns if a newer version is available.

### Client side

Now the steps which are required on the *Windows* machine.

#### *DefenderUpdate* script

The *PowerShell* script has been developed on *Windows Server 2016* and successfully tested on that operating system as well as *Windows 10* so far.

Create two directories on your system (for example)

*   `C:\Defender` (where the *Windows Defender* definitions will be stored in)
*   `C:\Tools\WiDeRedist` (the directory that contains the script files)

and copy the files `DefenderUpdate.ps1` as well as `Update.ini` into `C:\Tools\WiDeRedist`.

Edit the file `Update.ini` and adjust the network settings (web server IP address and port).

Then, run the *PowerShell* with **administrative privileges**. Inside that shell, execute the script as follows:

```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command C:\Tools\WiDeRedist\DefenderUpdate.ps1
```

In case the download fails, check the configuration of the web server as well as the network settings inside `Update.ini`.

#### Scheduled update task

In order to automatically update the *Windows Defender* definitions, you may use the *Windows* task scheduler to setup the update cycles. Notice that the task must be executed with an account that has **administrative privileges** as well as the preference **Run whether user is logged on or not** enabled.

For the task scheduler, the command to execute requires the full path to `powershell.exe`, so it looks like this:

```cmd
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command C:\Tools\WiDeRedist\DefenderUpdate.ps1
```

## Required update

In order to be able to continue using *WiDeRedist*, at least version **1.2.0** must be installed.

All versions below do not work anymore. The reason for that lies inside the server side script file. When running the server side script, it usually returns that the downloads have been completed successfully.

However, some of those files are only a few kilobytes in size and therefore useless. The reason why the download is incorrectly considered successful is that `wget` downloads the wrong file, which succeeds.

Before version 1.2.0, the definition files were downloaded from *Microsoft* using `wget` without giving any special arguments which has worked fine. Meanwhile the *Microsoft* servers do not seem to accept the default `wget` user agent string (e.g. `Wget/1.20.3 (linux-gnu)`) anymore.

Instead of returning an HTTP error, the server redirects to a web page which tells that the user agent is missing. Therefore, `wget` downloads that HTML file instead of any definition file. So, it fetches the wrong file which succeeds and this leads to the incorrect output.

Newer versions of *WiDeRedist* provide a corresponding user agent string which fixes the problem. If necessary, the string can be modified inside the server side config file.

Now there also is a file size verification of the downloaded files.

However, it is recommended to run either the server or client side script manually once in a while as it returns if a newer version is available.

## Useless facts

*   The project name is an abbreviation for ***Wi**ndows* ***De**fender* *Definition* ***Redist**ribution* (the second and thus repetitive "De" was omitted).
