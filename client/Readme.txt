    Definition

        The WiDeReDist project updates Windows Defender definitions (or
        signatures) in internal environments that are completely separated
        from the internet.

        Notice that the project consists of two components.

        This is only the client-side component (for Windows). The server-
        side component (for Linux and BSD) can also be downloaded from the
        GitHub repository.
