    Definition

        The WiDeReDist project updates Windows Defender definitons (or
        signatures) in internal environments that are completely separated
        from the internet.

        Notice that the project consists of two components.

        This is only the server-side component (for Linux and BSD). The
        client-side component (for Windows) can also be downloaded from the
        GitHub repository.

    Requirements

        The project does not have many requirements:

            - Some web server such as Apache or nginx (latter has been used in
              development)
            - The 'rsync' package (should already be pre-installed, depending
              on the distribution)
            - The 'wget' package (should already be pre-installed, also
              depending on the distribution)
            - The Bash shell (default in most Linux distributions, but usually
              not on BSD)
